Why the name Milan ?
</h1>

<p align="center">
The word ‚ÄòMilan‚Äô when literally translated from its colloquial form to English means ‚Äòconjugation‚Äô.
It is often seen that people get scammed and their money is stolen when they were just trying to do good for other people, they were trying to extend their help. Again, it is seen that there are some Clubs or NGOs who do not get enough funds to work for humanitarian causes because of the lack of proper representation.
